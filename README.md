Rubberduck
===========

> Put all the rubber ducks you like in your bath
> We do not want to know what you are going to do with them

Rubberduck is a python plugin system that doesn't get in your way.
It will provide utils to scan directories, import, register "objects", without
forcing you to have some structures.
Its approach strictly follows duck-typing principles.
